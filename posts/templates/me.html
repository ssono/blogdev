  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>If you asked someone on the street to describe Sage Ono in three words, they might say ”Who is that?” Now , if you asked me to describe myself and I was being honest it would look like the next few paragraphs.</p>
  <p>My name is Sage Ono and I am a computer science major at Emory University. I’ve lived in Atlanta, Georgia for eight years, but I am originally from Madison, Wisconsin. I spend most of my time either swimming or reading. I could go on about the swim meets I’ve won, the places I’ve traveled, and the things I’ve done, but I would rather tell you about what I want to do.  I want to change the world.
</p>
  <p>All of those sci-fi books got to me. If a protagonist that only exists in the words on the page, from a place that might resemble this world can face impossible odds and succeed, then so can I. Is it not better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all?
</p>
  <p>It sounds naive, but it's what I have to do. Nothing excites me more than tackling problems like education, climate change, conservation, except convincing others to do the same. Two heads are better than one. There is nothing to lose but time, and everything to gain.</p>
